This repository contains various scripts that are used occasionally in
VTechWorks workflows and maintenance.

Contents:

- event_capture: a directory containing scripts and executables used in 
                 preparing videos for deposit
                 
- split_csv_file.py: a script to split a CSV file of metadata into one separate
                     CSV file for each item. Used for the Dark Archive.

- make_mapfile.pl: Generate a DSpace mapfile based on an exported SAF
                   collection. This is useful when trying to use ItemImport
                   tools, but the mapfile is missing.
